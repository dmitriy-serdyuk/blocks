class MainLoop(object):
    """The standard main loop of Blocks.

    In the `MainLoop` a model is trained by a training algorithm using data
    extracted from a data stream. This process is scrupulously documented
    in a log object.

    The `MainLoop` itself does very little: only fetching the data from the
    data stream and feeding it to the algorithm. It expects the extensions
    to do most of the job. A respective callback of every extension is
    called at every stage of training. The extensions should communicate
    between themselves and with the main loop object by means of making
    records in the log. For instance in order to stop the training
    procedure an extension can make a record
    `training_finish_requested=True` in the log. The main loop checks for
    such a record after every batch and every epoch and terminates when
    finds it.

    The `MainLoop` also handles interruption signal SIGINT for you (e.g.
    the one program receives when you press Ctrl + C). It notes this event
    in the log and at the next iteration or epoch end the main loop will
    be gracefully finished, with calling all necessary extension callbacks
    and waiting until they finish.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : object
        The model object. It is entirely transparent for the main loop
        but may be used by extensions.
    data_stream : instance of :class:`.DataStream`.
        The data stream.
    algorithm : object
        The training algorithm.
    log : instance of :class:`.TrainingLog`
        The log. When not given, a :class:`.TrainingLog` is created.
    extensions : list of :class:`.TrainingExtension` instances
        The training extensions. Will be called in the same order as given
        here.
