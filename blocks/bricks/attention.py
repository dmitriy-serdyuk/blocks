"""Attention mechanisms.

We consider a hypothetical agent that wants to concentrate on particular
parts of a structured input. To do that the agent needs an *attention
mechanism* that given the *state* of the agent and the input signal outputs
*glimpses*.  For technical reasons we permit an agent to have a composite
state consisting of several components, to which we will refer as *states
of the agent* or simply *states*.

class SequenceContentAttention(Initializable):
    """Attention mechanism that looks for relevant content in a sequence.

    This is the attention mechanism used in [BCB]_. The idea in a nutshell:

    1. The states and the sequence are transformed independently,

    2. The transformed states are summed with every transformed sequence
       element to obtain *match vectors*,

    3. A match vector is transformed into a single number interpreted as
       *energy*,

    4. Energies are normalized in softmax-like fashion. The resulting
       summing to one weights are called *attention weights*,

    5. Linear combination of the sequence elements with attention weights
       is computed.

    This linear combinations from 5 and the attention weights from 4 form
    the set of glimpses produced by this attention mechanism. The former
    will be referred to as *glimpses* in method documentation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    state_names : list of str
        The names of the agent states.
    sequence_dim : int
        The dimension of the sequence elements.
    match_dim : int
        The dimension of the match vector.
    state_transformer : :class:`.Brick`
        A prototype for state transformations. If ``None``, the default
        transformation from :class:`.Parallel` is used.
    sequence_transformer : :class:`.Brick`
        The transformation to be applied to the sequence. If ``None`` an
        affine transformation is used.
    energy_computer : :class:`.Brick`
        Computes energy from the match vector. If ``None``, an affine
        transformations is used.

    See :class:`.Initializable` for initialization parameters.
