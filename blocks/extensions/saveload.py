    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str

    Notes
    -----
    Instead of the standard pickling library, the dill package is used.

    Using pickling for saving the whole main loop object comes with
    certain limitations:

    * Theano computation graphs build in the GPU-mode
      (`theano.config.device == "gpu"`) can not be used in the usual mode
      (and vice-versa). Therefore using this extension binds you to using
      only one kind of device.
